# sqlafunccodegen

Generate type-annotated Python functions that wrap PostgreSQL functions, using
asyncpg and, optionally, SQLAlchemy.
Like [sqlacodegen](https://github.com/agronholm/sqlacodegen)
but for functions instead of tables.

Benefit over PostgREST: You can call functions and execute other SQL within
a transaction.

Usage:
```bash
sqlafunccodegen --help
```

Capabilities:
* "func" mode: functions directly wrap `sqlalchemy.func.<function_name>`
  * no types, just parameter names
* "python" and "asyncpg_only" modes: functions execute a select statement and
  return results
  * many basic types
  * enums
  * arrays
  * Pydantic models for user-defined composite types
  * set-returning functions return iterables
  * constraints in domains are not checked but the underlying type is used
  * the Python types may be too restrictive or not restrictive enough, the
    correspondence isn't perfect. some types aren't recognized and the generic
    form in which sqlafunccodegen attempts to send them to the database may not
    work.
* all modes:
  * comments as docstrings
  * functions with overloads not supported
  * polymorphic pseudo-types not supported
  * `IN`, `INOUT`, and `VARIADIC` params not supported
  * default values are not available

Generated code dependencies:
* asyncpg
* Pydantic 2
* SQLAlchemy 2 (except for "asyncpg_only" mode)

Examples
* input: [`tests/schema.ddl`](tests/schema.ddl)
* "python" mode output: [`tests/out_python.py`](tests/out_python.py)
* "func" mode output: [`tests/out_func.py`](tests/out_func.py)
* "asyncpg_only" mode output: [`tests/out_asyncpg_only.py`](tests/out_asyncpg_only.py)

[sqlc](https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc) can be used with its [Python plugin](https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc-gen-python)
to generate Python functions that wrap SQL snippets that live in the application project rather than
the database. This is similar to the [Python codegen for EdgeDB](https://docs.edgedb.com/libraries/python/api/codegen).
As of v1.26.0, a schema file is required, which can be generated [using pg_dump](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14486505/371334).
A complete `sqlc.yaml` file might look like this:
```yaml
version: "2"
plugins:
- name: py
  wasm:
    url: https://downloads.sqlc.dev/plugin/sqlc-gen-python_1.2.0.wasm
    sha256: a6c5d174c407007c3717eea36ff0882744346e6ba991f92f71d6ab2895204c0e
sql:
  - engine: "postgresql"
    database:
      uri: "postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable"
    queries: "application_queries.sql"
    schema: "pg_dump_output.sql"
    codegen:
    - out: sqlc_out
      plugin: py
      options:
        package: "foo"
        emit_async_querier: true
```
You can use `sqlc` to call Postgres functions by writing queries like `select * from f()`. As of v1.26.0,
sqlc lacks some type features that sqlafunccodegen has such as JSON types, composite-type table columns, and
using immutable types for inputs. sqlc
uses dataclasses instead of Pydantic models.
